In this project, I created a Burger and Fries Generator.I designed three different types of burgers:
Classic, Veggie, and Double, each with its own combination of layers like lettuce, tomato, 
cheese, and patty.Pressing the keys C, V, or D allows users to add different types of burgers onto
a plate, while pressing F adds a group of randomly placed fries.

I chose to create burgers and fries because they’re my favorite food. I often enjoy eating them, 
 and I even like to make burgers myself at home.This project also connects to a bigger dream 
I’ve had for a long time: opening my own fast food restaurant someday.
