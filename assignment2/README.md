For this assignment, I first created a grid of shapes using two nested for-loops. I started with circles, and then used map() on the Y axis so that the shapes at the top stay straight while the ones at the bottom rotate more. This way the composition gradually becomes more chaotic, inspired by Georg Neesâ€™ Schotter.

Then I added interactivity. When the mouse is pressed, the circles switch to triangles, and I applied random displacement so the triangles shake and look disorderly. When the mouse is not pressed, the shapes stay as circles.

Finally, I made the colors respond to mouse movement.
