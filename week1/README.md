# PROGRAM OR BE PROGRAMMED


## First quote

> "In the emerging, highly programmed landscape ahead, you will either create the so# ware or you will be the so# ware. It’s really that simple: Program, or be programmed."


> **My thought**


> This quote stood out to me because it shows how powerful programming is in shaping the future. I agree with it since technology is everywhere, and if we don't understand how it works, we might just follow it blindly. For me, it realtes to learning programming skills becasue coding gives me the ability to be a creator, not just a passive user, I have a chance to building the tools that shape our lives.  


## Second quote

> " As a result, instead of optimizing our machines for humanity — or even the benefi t of some particular group—we are optimizing humans for machinery."


> **My thought**


> I agree with this quote because many times we just rush to create the newest technology without asking if we really need it. A real example is when schools using onlline learning platforms, students and teachers often spend more time figuring out the system than actually learning or teaching. For learning programming, this reminds me that coding should focus on making tools simple that can support people, not confusing people.


## Third quote


> "Like the participants of media revolutions before our own, we have embraced the new technologies and literacies of our age without actually learning how they work and work on us."


> **My Thought**


> This quote stood out to me becasue it reminds me that just using technology is not enough, we also need to understand how technology shoapes our thinking and behavior. I agree with it, sinch people often adopt new apps or tools quickly but don't stop to ask how they influencing us. For learning programming, this make me understand how system works, and gainning the power to shape technology.
