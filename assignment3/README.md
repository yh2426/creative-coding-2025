//This project is about Time as Water in a Measuring tube
//so the tube and the trapezoid represent the mesuring tube
//This clock is inspired by the memory of high school science experiments 
//when liqluid was carefully poured into a measuring cup to observe changes.
//time itself becomes that liquid.
//second(): controls a single droplet that falls down
//minute(): controls the rising blue bar, representing the gradual filling of the tube.
//hour(): adds small drops resting in the trapezoid base, representing time that has settled â€” the past hours.
//I am still considering whether to include 24 drops in total or just 12, representing AM and PM.
//Maybe changing the background color to reflect day and night and add some graph
//Also I am thinking of adding a faucet on top and a flame at the bottom. 
// The faucet would show time flowing in; the flame shows time being consumed. I am sill try to fingure out how to draw it.
