This project is about Time as Water in a Measuring tube，so the tube and the trapezoid represent the mesuring tube.
This clock is inspired by the memory of high school science experiments, when liqluid was carefully poured into a measuring cup to observe changes.time itself becomes that liquid.

I want to show that time passes quickly, like boiling water.The whole image is designed as a metaphor: 
The falling droplet represents seconds， time constantly dripping down.
The rising blue water level represents minutes，time gradually filling up.
The drops resting in the base represent hours，time that has already passed.
The faucet at the top suggests time flowing in, while the flame at the bottom symbolizes time being consumed.
